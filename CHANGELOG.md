# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Features

- **`mdwrap`** — add `-f` to wrap footnote bodies to the column width, indenting continuation lines four spaces (valid footnote continuation in strict engines).

### Bug fixes

- **`mdsplit`** — never split sentences inside a footnote definition. A definition and its continuation lines are now treated as one block and passed through unchanged, so multi-sentence footnotes stay portable. This also applies to `mdjoin`, `mdwrap`, and `mdunwrap`.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-06-21

### Bug fixes

- **`mdsplit`** — don't split a sentence inside an inline span (code spans, links, emphasis `*`/`_`/`**`, and strikethrough `~~`); previously a sentence boundary within the span orphaned its delimiters across lines. A sentence that ends inside a span (e.g. `**Done.** Next`) now breaks after the span.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-21

### Bug fixes

- **`mdsplit`** — fix sentences being split inside inline footnotes (`^[...]`), and fix two sentences being joined onto one line when a footnote (`[^1]` or `^[...]`) follows the terminal punctuation of the first.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-16

### Features

- Add `-v` and `-version` flags to every tool, printing `<tool> <version>`.

### Changes

- `-i` is now a boolean flag with the destination file passed as a positional argument (mirroring `-w`). The command form `mdsplit X | mdtable -i X` is unchanged.
- Aligned help output: all flag names line up in a single column regardless of length.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-16

### Features

- Add `-i FILE` flag to every tool: read stdin, write the transformed result to `FILE`. Enables the natural pipe chain `mdsplit X | mdtable -i X` to round-trip a file through both transforms in one command. `-i` is mutually exclusive with `-w` and requires data on stdin.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-06-02

### Bug fixes

- **`mdtable`** — fix `|` inside backtick code spans being treated as a column delimiter.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-05-28

### Bug fixes

- **`mdtable`** — fix column misalignment when cells contain multi-byte Unicode characters (e.g. `—`, `→`); width was measured in bytes instead of display columns.
- **`mdwrap`** — fix lines wrapping too early when words contain multi-byte Unicode characters; same byte-vs-rune miscounting as `mdtable`.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-05-27

### Bug fixes

- **`mdsplit`** — fix sentence boundary not recognized when the next sentence starts with a backtick (or any non-lowercase character such as `_`, `[`, `*`, or a digit).

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-30

### Tooling

- Add `scripts/release` to automate tagging, SHA256 computation, and Homebrew tap updates.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-30

### Bug fixes

- **`mdref`** — fix silent skip of inline links whose text begins with emphasis or strong markup (e.g. `[_foo_](url)`, `[**bar**](url)`).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-29

### Bug fixes

- **`mdref`** — fix silent skip of inline links whose text is a code span (e.g. `` [`Foo`](url) ``).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-29

Initial release.
Ten composable CLI tools for manipulating GitHub Flavored Markdown.

### Links

- **`mdref`** — converts inline-style links to numbered reference-style links collected at the bottom of the document.
- **`mdinline`** — converts reference-style links back to inline links.

### Annotations

- **`mdfnt`** — renumbers footnote references (`[^label]`) to sequential integers in order of first appearance, updating the corresponding definitions.
- **`mdsidenote`** — converts markdown footnotes to HTML sidenote markup compatible with Tufte CSS.
- **`mdfootnote`** — converts Tufte CSS sidenote HTML markup back to markdown footnotes.

### Sentence structure

- **`mdsplit`** — splits sentences within paragraphs onto individual lines (one sentence per line).
- **`mdjoin`** — joins one-sentence-per-line paragraphs back into contiguous paragraph text.

### Tables

- **`mdtable`** — normalizes GFM table column widths, padding each cell to the column maximum for visual alignment in plain text.

### Hard wrapping

- **`mdwrap`** — wraps body text to 60 characters (configurable with `-c`). Table and list structure is preserved.
- **`mdunwrap`** — removes hard line breaks, restoring text into contiguous paragraphs. Table and list structure is preserved.
